# Podcasting

### If you want to see the project in action, [visit the delpoyed project on Heroku](https://the-shoppies-awards.herokuapp.com/)!

This project is my submission for the Pandora + SiriusXM Fullstack Apprenticeship created by [OnRamp + Pandora + SiriusXM](https://www.onramp.io/ts/role/5fff36934646b33c661f3d83). The project was built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started), [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In this project you are presented with a webpage that loads a selection of Podcasts to listen to. If you want to save a podcast to your favorites list, you can simply drag and drop podcasts into your favorites list. If you want to remove a podcast from your favorites list, simply drag it out of the list and watch it disappear. Even if you leave the page or reload, the state of your favorites list will stay persistent.
